# hello-world
This is my first attempt at learning Github.  Gotta grow out of the limitations of hardware engineering and become one with the matrix.

Starting a journey to move away from my hw infrastructure roots and gain a better understanding of sw development practices.

Beginning to understand value prop of having everything in source control.  May seem like second nature to a software developer, but not so much to a legacy hardware engineer.
